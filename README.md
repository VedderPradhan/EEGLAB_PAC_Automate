# EEGLAB_PAC_Automate
##EEGLAB in Matlab has a hisotry variable EEG.hisory or eegh to create Matlab scripts. However, PAC, a plugin to EEGLAB does not have a way to view the history to create Matlab scripts.
##As a result a PAC user will be overwhelmed when given numerous edf files to compute PAC as the only option is with GUI (calculating PAC for each and every parameter/edf file).
##This project is an effort to combine GUI(PAC plugin for EEGLAB) and Matlab script(Till EEGLAB)
